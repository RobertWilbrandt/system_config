# system_config
Initial system configuration setup

## Install i3 window manager

To install the i3 window manager with the default status bar and the dmenu_run launcher use

```console
sudo apt install i3-wm i3status suckless-tools
```

## Keyboard layout

In order to store the keyboard layout consistently, edit/add the following lines to ```/etc/default/keyboard```:

```console
XKBLAYOUT="de"
XKBVARIANT="neo"
```

## Locale setup

First, check if all required locales are generated by looking at the output of ```locale -a```. If a required one is missing, generate it by using the command ```sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales```. Afterwards, set your intended locales in the ```/etc/default/locale``` file. You can use the ```locale``` command to check your current configuration. This might look like

```console
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_CTYPE="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="de_DE.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="de_DE.UTF-8"
```

## Setup zsh as default shell

You first need to install zsh, and then use the ```chsh``` command to set it as default:

```console
sudo apt install zsh
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```
